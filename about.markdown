# About

Edward Jansen is a senior undergraduate student at Adelphi University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Physics. He has extensive research experience, having worked as an undergraduate researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he interned under the Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science twice. There he applied artificial intelligence and active learning to solve complex high-dimensionality multi-parameter problems, and acquired results he and his teammates intend to publish. He also studied theoretical concepts and presented experimental results using algorithms such as the Gaussian Process, Bayesian Optimization, support vector machines, and graph neural networks.

Edward is proficient in Python, including libraries like Scikit-Learn and PyTorch, and has experience with other tools such as Linux OS, Bash scripting, and MATLAB. His programming experience also includes implementing optimization techniques such as gradient descent, Monte Carlo global optimization, and simulated annealing. Additionally, he has developed and applied neural networks in his research, using these and other techniques to analyze large materials science datasets.

Beyond computational skills, Edward has a strong background in physics and mathematics, which he has applied to address complex, real-world problems in his research projects. This knowledge spans condensed matter theory, solid state physics, and classical and quantum mechanics with specific experience in Langevin Dynamics, spin dynamics in magnetic systems, phase diagrams and transitions of materials, analytical and numerical solutions to classical and quantum Hamiltonians and Lagrangians, as well as the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

Edward's commitment to finding alternative energy solutions drives his interest in superconducting materials, which began with his first steps into inorganic chemistry four years ago. He has since synthesized, tested, and validated high-temperature superconducting compounds as part of an ongoing study on superconductor discovery at Adelphi University. He is currently writing a thesis on this project which integrates his theoretical and experimental abilities in materials science, superconductivity, and machine learning applications.

Jansen has presented his findings and progress at conferences, including the American Physical Society (APS) March Meeting and the NIST AI for Materials Science Conference, has a publication in works, has four years of experience in an academic research environment, and continues to collaborate with his research team in the Federal Government at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
