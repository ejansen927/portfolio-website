# Welcome to Edward Jansen's Research Site
### Documentation of concepts and research

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the potential of science to solve some of the world's most complex problems. My journey into physics, particularly superconductors, began with a simple question: how can we create materials that revolutionize our energy systems?

Energy is precious, and the quest to find efficient, sustainable solutions is more urgent than ever. This passion drives my research into superconductors, as they hold the key to transforming how we store, transmit, and use energy in the future.

Superconductors are a material that— under certain conditions— harness the ability to conduct electricity without resistance. The issue: these conditions are often impractical to achieve, such as temperatures close to absolute zero or pressures upwards of hundreds of gigapascals. With recent innovations in artificial intelligence, there is an immense opportunity to study vast amounts of data and reveal insights and correlations underlying the theory of superconductivity. This is the focus of my research, and as I look towards a graduate school that aligns with my objectives, I aim to deepen my expertise in materials science and superconductivity while leveraging cutting edge models, techniques, and theories to push the boundaries of this field.

I intend to use this site as a research portfolio—a place to document my work and share knowledge with others who share my interests. As an undergraduate at Adelphi University preparing for graduate school, I hope this site will also serve as a platform to connect with like-minded researchers and showcase my journey in materials science and superconductivity.
